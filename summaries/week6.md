# Week 6 - Emotions and Non-verbal behaviour in HRI

## Can we feel emotions towards robots?

#### **Study 1: The "Torture" Experiment (Rosenthal-von der Pütten et al., 2013)**

- **Hypothesis:**
    - (H1a) People will feel more negative affect watching a robot being tortured compared to treated nicely.
    - (H1b) People will show higher physiological arousal during the torture video.
- **Method:**
    - **Design:** 2x2. Factors: **Prior Interaction** (Yes/No) and **Type of Video** (Friendly/Torture).
    - **Stimuli:** Videos of a dinosaur robot (Pleo) being stroked/fed vs. choked/hit/punched.
    - **Measures:** Physiological (Skin Conductance - SCR, ECG), Self-report (PANAS, Empathy scale).
- **Results:**
    - **Empathy:** Participants felt significantly more **pity** for the robot and **anger** toward the torturer in the torture condition.
    - **Attribution:** After the torture video, participants attributed significantly fewer positive feelings to the robot (perceiving it as "sad" or "hurt").
- **Conclusion:** Humans do feel empathy toward robots, and witnessing abuse elicits negative emotional and physiological responses.

#### **Study 2: Empathy & Embodiment (Seo et al., 2015)**
- **Scenario:** A robot plays Sudoku with a human to build rapport. It then reveals a "fear" of being fixed because it might lose its memory. It gets fixed and actually loses its memory ("I don't remember you").
- **Variable (Embodiment):**
    1.  Physical Robot (Nao).
    2.  Mixed-Reality (Live video feed).
    3.  On-screen 3D simulation.
- **Results:**
    - **Scenario Effect:** The story successfully elicited empathy across all groups.
    - **Embodiment Effect:** Participants reported **significantly higher empathy with the Physical Robot** compared to the virtual versions.

#### Lessons Learned:
- People respond emotionally to robotd (even in videos).
- Physical robots raise more emotional responses than virtual ones.
